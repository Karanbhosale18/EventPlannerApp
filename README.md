 Event management is the application of project management to the creation and development
 of large or small scale events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, formal parties,
 concerts, or conventions. The last few years have seen a rapid growth in the event
 management industry. Considering the existing system problems related to event management
 we are developing an android application for event management. This application will be
 accessible only for android. Application will mainly focus on birthday party, marriage
 functions and social events. The application will be developed using Android studio and back
 end will be managed in Firebase database. Application will have easy and feasible GUI for all
 type of users. User needs to Login at the initial phase, set his/her profile details including
 location, choices, email-id, etc. User can modify or change His/her profile at any stage. The
 core phase of the application will display list of events based on the user profile details. This
 event will further contain description about event, its exact location, ticket rates (if any), date
 and time. These details will be firstly verified by the administrator to fulfill the security
 protocols. In this paper we present an android mobile phone application to make it easier for a
 layman to plan an event in a hassle-free manner. This application will assist him/her in
 planning a successful and fun event
